Content Staging makes it easy to work with content in a private environment before deploying posts, images, users, terms etc. to your live site.

== Description ==

With Content Staging you can prepare content in your staging environment, hidden away from the eye of the public. When
your content is ready to be released you simply push it to your live site.

Content Staging was built to support professional web sites where content editors need to push large amounts of posts per
batch.

You organize your posts into different batches. You can have as many or as few batches as you want and you are in full
control to decide what posts goes into what batch. Deploying one of the batches to your live site is easy - any content
related to selected posts is automatically included in the batch (e.g. images, users, terms) and synced to your
production environment.

Content Staging comes with full support for your multi-site setup.

== Installation ==

Upload `content-staging` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on both your environments (staging and production).

Generate a secret key, this can be whatever you like, just make sure its long and impossible to guess. You can use a
key generated by https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/ if you wish.

Add the following to your wp-config.php file on your staging environment:

	define( 'CONTENT_STAGING_SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_GENERATED_KEY' );
    define( 'CONTENT_STAGING_ENDPOINT', 'https://_YOUR_PRODUCTION_SITE_.com' );
    define( 'CONTENT_STAGING_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT', 60 );

Add the following to your wp-config.php file on your production environment:

	define( 'CONTENT_STAGING_SECRET_KEY', 'YOUR_GENERATED_KEY' );

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress on both your staging site and your live site.

*Notice:* Its important that the /xmlrpc.php file is accessible on both environment (usually placed in root directory of
your WordPress installation).
